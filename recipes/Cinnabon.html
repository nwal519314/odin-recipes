    <ul>
         

            <li>   8 ounces cream cheese softened</li>
        
            <li>  1/2 cup confectioners sugar</li>
        
            <li>  8 tablespoons softened butter, divided</li>
        
            <li>  1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        
            <li> 1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        
            <li> 1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        
            <li>  12 Hawaiian slider rolls</li>
        
            <li> 3/4 cup white sugar</li>
        
            <li> 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
        
    </ul>

    <ol>
       
        <li>
Combine cream cheese, confectioner’s sugar,
 2 tablespoons softened butter, vanilla, lemon 
 juice and salt together in a medium bowl and mix
  with an electric mixer or whisk until smooth and 
  well blended. Transfer mixture to a resealable plastic bag or piping bag. </li>
  <li>
Use a paring knife to cut a 1/2-inch slit in one side of each roll.
 Use a small spoon handle or finger to form a well in the center of each
  roll through the slit without going all the way through to the other side. </li> 
  <li>
Snip the corner of the plastic bag and fill each roll with cream cheese mixture. 
It helps to use a small offset spatula or the end of a small spoon to work the
 mixture in to get an ample amount of filling inside without it oozing out the side.</li>
 <li>
Melt remaining butter in a small bowl and brush a light coating of butter on each roll. </li>
<li>
Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to 
manufacturer’s instructions. Stir together sugar and cinnamon in a shallow dish.</li>
<li>
Working in batches to avoid overcrowding, air fry filled rolls 
until browned and toasted, about 3 minutes. Immediately coat warm rolls
 evenly with cinnamon sugar. Brush with more butter if necessary before dipping in 
 cinnamon sugar to help sugar adhere. </li>
    </ol>
